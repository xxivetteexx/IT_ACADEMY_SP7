### THE EXERCICE:
Build an interactive website to learn theater texts. Apply the basic techniques and add styles and  actions to the web, so the user can interact with our application.

### LEVEL 1:

```Exercice 1.```

Make an application that reads a json file with the texts of a play and displays each of the texts on the screen.

[

 "Hola Romeo.", 

"Hola Julieta", 

"T'estimo, Romeo", 

"I jo a tu Julieta", 

"Escapem-nos a Mèxic", 

"Millor no, no li caus bé a la meva família i si seguim endavant amb el nostre amor, aquesta història acabarà malament", 

"Doncs vaja" 

]

### LEVEL 2:

```Exercice 2.```

Layout the application using styled-components.

### LEVEL 3:

```Exercice 3.```

In this step we will show only one line instead of all in the application.

Add the forward and backward buttons that will allow us to go forward or backward between the lines of the application to show only one at a time.

### LEVEL 4:

```Exercice 4.```
Show all the lines of the application but we will highlight only one at a time, which will change as we press the forward or backward buttons.
